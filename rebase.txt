It is also possible to run mobile tests on real devices (Currently only Android is supported). In case of running tests on real devices additional parameters are supported:

-Dplatform - determine if IOS or ANDROID should be used
-Dplatform-version - get device's uuid from mobile config for provided platform version
-Ddevice-id - get device with provided uuid
If both platform-version and device-id are provided device with provided uuid would be chosen.
